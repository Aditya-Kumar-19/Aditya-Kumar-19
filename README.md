# 👋 Hi, I'm Aditya Kumar  
🎯 **Aspiring Cybersecurity Analyst** | 🛡️ **AWS Cloud Certified** | 🐧 **Linux Enthusiast** | 🕵️‍♂️ **OSINT & Threat Intelligence Explorer**

## 💼 About Me

I'm a cybersecurity-driven **MCA student** with a sharp focus on **cloud infrastructure, digital forensics, and open-source intelligence (OSINT)**. With hands-on experience in securing AWS environments, analyzing attack patterns, and hardening Linux systems, I aim to bridge the gap between offensive tactics and defensive strategy.

Whether I'm simulating attacks in a red vs. blue lab, building OSINT toolkits, or scanning IoT devices for vulnerabilities, I thrive in solving real-world security problems. I believe that **security isn’t just about tools—it's about understanding systems, thinking critically, and staying one step ahead.**

🔭 **Currently diving deeper into**:
- Cloud-native security & monitoring
- Threat hunting using logs and indicators
- IoT ecosystem vulnerability research
- Linux system hardening and policy enforcement

## 🚀 Currently Exploring

- **Cloud Security Architecture & Best Practices**  
  Gaining hands-on experience with secure AWS deployments, IAM hardening, and incident response in cloud-native environments.

- **Threat Detection, Logging & Analysis**  
  Interpreting logs from Linux systems and AWS CloudTrail to identify anomalies, correlate IOCs, and build incident timelines.

- **Red Team & Blue Team Methodologies**  
  Participating in CTFs and attack-defense labs focused on real-world adversary tactics and MITRE ATT&CK mapping.

- **Linux System Hardening & Monitoring**  
  Using AppArmor, auditd, UFW/iptables, and bash scripting to lock down systems and create reusable security baselines.

- **OSINT Automation & Intelligence Gathering**  
  Building a centralized toolkit with Python-based automation for recon, reporting, and alerting.

- **IoT & Embedded Device Security**  
  Researching smart device vulnerabilities and testing custom scanning techniques with ESP32-based hardware.
